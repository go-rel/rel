# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here's some way you on how you can contribute to this project:

- Report any bug, feature request and questions using issues.
- Contribute directly to the development, don't hestitate to take any task available on [projects](https://github.com/Fs02/rel/projects) page. You can use issues if you need further discussion and help about the implementation.
- Improvement to the documentation is always welcomed.
- Star and let the world know about this project.

Thanks :heart: :heart: :heart:
